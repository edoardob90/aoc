# Advent of Code 2025 🎄🎅
### The *Twelve Days of Christmas* edition

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles:

- 🐍 Python (`<day>.py`)
- 🐺 Wolfram Language (`<day>.wls`), requires [WolframScript](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript/)[^1]

[^1]: WolframScript is a command-line interpreter for the Wolfram Language. It requires a kernel running "somewhere", either in the cloud or locally. It works even without a full license for Wolfram Mathematica/Desktop, via the [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/).

## Notes

- Solutions aim to use standard libraries when possible.
- Each solution is ran against the example data from the puzzle to verify it produces the expected result. **Caveat:** This doesn't always guarantee that the solution is correct for the full input, because there might be edge cases.
- Input files and puzzle texts are not included due to Advent of Code's copyright.
