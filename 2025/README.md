## Notes

- Solutions aim to use standard libraries when possible.
- Each solution is ran against the example data from the puzzle to verify it produces the expected result. **Caveat:** This doesn't always guarantee that the solution is correct for the full input, because there might be edge cases.
- Input files and puzzle texts are not included due to Advent of Code's copyright.
